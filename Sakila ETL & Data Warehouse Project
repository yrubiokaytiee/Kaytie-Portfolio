# Sakila ETL & Data Warehouse Project

**Tech:** MySQL, Python, ETL workflows, data modeling, visualization

**Overview:**  
For my Data Science Systems course, I built a full ETL pipeline and analytics warehouse using the open-source Sakila film rental database.

**What I did:**
- Designed and implemented an ETL workflow to extract, clean, and load rental and customer data into a MySQL database.
- Modeled the data into star schema tables optimized for analytics.
- Wrote SQL queries to calculate KPIs such as most rented films, rental revenue by category, and customer segmentation.
- Created visual dashboards to present insights on film rental patterns and store performance.

**Key Skills:**  
ETL design, SQL optimization, data warehouse modeling, Python scripting, visualization.

**Impact:**  
Demonstrated ability to handle real-world data pipelines, transform raw data into analytics-ready formats, and communicate findings effectively.
