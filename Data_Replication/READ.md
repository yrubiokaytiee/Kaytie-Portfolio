# Data Replication Projects in R

This folder showcases my work replicating published data analyses and visualizations using **R**.

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Cleaning and transforming research datasets
- Calculating statistical effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d, Hedges’ g)
- Creating reproducible visualizations with `ggplot2`
- Documenting workflows for transparency and reproducibility

These projects highlight my ability to understand scientific studies, reproduce key metrics, and present data-driven insights clearly.
